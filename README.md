First repository

Hello World!
This is Calaxar, and I am learning the basics of GitHub by creating this repository and following the Hello-World Guide. I have had some experience with using Git in the command line and Bitbucket previously through my university course, but this is my first foray into the world of GitHub, so I hope I get the hang of it soon enough!
